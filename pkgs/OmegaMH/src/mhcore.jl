`mh(rng, ΩT, logdensity, f, n; proposal, state_init)`

Metropolis Hastings Sampler

Initialised at `state_init`, yields `n` samples `::ΩT` using Metropolis Hastings algorithm.

# Arguments
- `rng`: AbstractRng used to sample proposals in MH loop
- `ΩT`: Type of samples
- `n`: number of samples
- `logdensity`:  Density that `mh` will sample from. Function of `ω`.
- `f`: The random variable that we are taking samples from
- `proposal`: a proposal distributioion.   Has the form:
  `(ω_, log_p_q) = proposal(rng, ω)` where:
    `ω_` is the proposal
    `log_pqqp` is `log(g(p|q)/g(q|p))` the transition probability of moving from q to p
- `state_init`: point to initialise from
- `keep`: function from `i -> b::Bool` which says whether to keep the sample at ith iteration or not
Useful for defining burn in or thinning.
  Example `keep = i -> ignorefirstn(100)(i) & thin(m)(i)`
