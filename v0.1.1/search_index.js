For example, rainfall depends on temperature, the season, the presence of clouds, and so on. With respect to a model, expected rainfall is a real value, but it changes if we obtain new information. For example it rises if we observe clouds and falls to zero if we observe their absence. These two expectations becomes a random variable over expectations – a conditional expectation – when we take into account the probabilities of the presence or absence of clouds. Moreover, for each random variable in the model there is a corresponding conditional expectation. For instance, with respect to the season, conditional expected rainfall is a random variable over four expectations, one for each season; with respect to temperature it is a continuous distribution. These conditional expectations capture the uncertainty over expected rainfall that results from other variables in the model, whereas the unconditional expected rainfall averages all the uncertainty away.","category":"page"},{"location":"higher/#","page":"Distributional Inference","title":"Distributional Inference","text":"Omega has a number of mechanisms to automatically capture the uncertainty over any distributional property.
